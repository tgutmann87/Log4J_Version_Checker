### Log4J_Version_Checker
---

The purpose of this tool is to allow the user to check the version of Log4J installed on their machine. I created this utility in response to CVE-2021-44228 to help my IT department to find the version number once we identified machines with the JAR located on it. It's a pretty simple script that uses the following syntax:

`python Log4J_Version_Checker.py <Location_of_Log4J_JAR>`
